			Pianist Lisa Kaplan and percussionist Matthew Duvall are founding members of the Grammy-winning contemporary music institution eighth blackbird, one of Chicago’s most successful and staunchest advocates of the new. The ensemble is currently the artist-in-residence at the Museum of Contemporary Art—a rare distinction for a musical entity—so it’s fitting that they kick off the festival in the current digs. This evening they present a typically dynamic program including David Lang’s wed, John Luther Adams’s Red Arc Blue Veil, and Steve Reich’s classic Piano Phase, adopted for toy pianos. The duo has also hinted the program might include some brand-new music composed by Kaplan herself.

			<div class="text">Since forming in 2012, Fonema Consort has steadily gained a well-deserved reputation as one Chicago’s most daring new music groups, with a special focus on experimental vocal repertoire and new compositions from the Spanish-speaking world—whether from co-leader Pablo Chin’s own Costa Rica, Spain, or countless South American locales. Tonight’s program demonstrates that interest as its has manifested in Europe. Complementing German master Helmut Lachenmann’s Salut für Caudwell, is a classic by German-Argentine great Mauricio Kagel (Atem) and a brand-new commission from Mesias Maiguashca, an Ecuadorian-born composer based in Germany since the mid-60s, who will be in attendance for tonight’s concert. The program is rounded out with basalto by Ecuadorian-American Juan Campoverde, who teaches composition at Northwestern University. Made possible thanks to support from by the Goethe Institut.

			<div class="text">a.pe.ri.od.ic is a Chicago-based performance collective specializing in post-Cagean notated, acoustic, experimental music. Founded in 2010, a.pe.ri.od.ic's repertoire explores the indeterminacy in various musical elements including instrumentation, structure, pitch, and/or duration. Called “daring,” by the Chicago Reader, the group, led by composer Nomi Epstein, focuses on scores primarily notated with prose. This evening’s concert features music “quiet and absurd” including Laura Steenberge's Elevator Music, James Klopfleisch's Read Two Parts, Scott Cazan's Limit Ordinal, Matt Sargent's Tide, and Julia Holter's Slow Song Slow.  Concluding the program is Opus 2 from Tim Parkinson's opera Time With People, a work the ensemble will perform in full next season. The evening will include trash, white noise, glissandi, clapping, mimicking, and vocal 'dums.'

			<div class="text">Mocrep is dedicated to the performance of radical, 21st-century music that engages with contemporary culture --aesthetically, socially, and politically. Mocrep specializes in works that not only synthesize music, theater, and performance art, but also  productively embrace the differences between these mediums. In this way, they hope to expose and explore new possibilities in performance today. Tonight’s performance will consist of both U.S. and world premieres of works by two young and innovative German composers: Maximilian Marcoll and Mathias Monrad Møller. Invaluable support provided by the Goethe Institut.

			<div class="text">Since forming in 2006 Meehan/Perkins Duo (Todd Meehan and Doug Perkins) has redefined the American percussion duo through its diverse commissions and engaging performances. Last year they released Parallels by Tristan Perich, a 50-minute work for hi-hats, tuned triangles, and 1-bit electronics, which they performed on the Frequency Series in 2013. Tonight they present two world premieres including a collaboration with Scott Lindroth and his robotic orchestra of found metals, Clockwork. Much of the piece is performed on discarded and recycled materials that have been reanimated as musical instruments that are either mechanically triggered or played live by the duo and processed to make beautiful tapestries of resonant sound. This concert will also feature Alex Wroten’s new work, Mosaic, that is a duo for more traditional metal percussion instruments.

			<div class="text">Grammy-winning flutist Tim Munro, who celebrated the release of his striking solo album one two three (Parlour Tapes+) with an unforgettable Constellation concert in the fall of 2014, brings an ambitious new project to the venue, giving his first solo performance since leaving eighth blackbird last year. Over the course of four years, Munro will play all of the component parts of L'opera for solo flute by Salvatore Sciarrino. L'opera is a flickering, glowing, splintering, murmuring vision that is unique and transfixing, and will stretch Munro to his absolute technical and musical limit. In this first installment, he matches the magic of the winter light to two pieces from L'opera that conjure the otherworldly: “With the auras in the distance,” and “Is this how spells are made?”

			<div class="text">Claire Chase
 
MacArthur Fellow, International Contemporary Ensemble founder, and flute virtuoso Claire Chase returns to Constellation for the first time since the fall of 2013. She presents the latest iteration of Density 2036, a 22-year project begun she launched in 2014 to commission an entirely new body of repertory for solo flute each year until the 100th Anniversary of Edgard Varèse’s groundbreaking 1936 flute solo, Density 21.5. Each season between 2014-2036, Chase will premiere a new 60-minute program of solo flute work commissioned that year in a special performance at The Kitchen in New York City and on tour in select cities thereafter. Additionally, each cycle of works (Density 2014, Density 2015, Density 2020, etc.) will be released in their world premiere recordings annually, and scores, performance notes, videos and related materials be made available digitally as educational resources for flutists and composers everywhere. Every 3-5 years of the cycle, a retrospective event will be held in which Chase will perform cumulative concerts of all Density works commissioned up until that date. In 2036, a 24-hour marathon will take place. Tonight’s concert includes the titular masterpiece by Varese alongside new work by Dai Fujukura, Francesca Verunelli, Nathan Davis, Jason Eckardt, and Pauline Oliveros.

			<div class="text">The Spektral Quartet’s identity and orientation draws inspiration from within chamber music practice dating back to the quartets of Haydn, just as they forge uncharted sonic ground with the most forward-thinking composers of today. The musical style and current projects of German-born Chicago resident Hans Thomalla beautifully mirror the group’s approach to the string quartet. His music takes fragments of tradition and uses them as a germinative seeds for his musical vocabulary, while concurrently dealing with materials on their own acoustical terms. Titled “Bagatellen,” this commission was made possible by the Ernst von Siemens Foundation, with additional support from Goethe-Institut Chicago. Austro-Swiss composer Beat Furrer's "String Quartet No. 3" completes the program. This large-scale work, with its radical form and prismatic treatment of musical materials, spins out from the 16th-century chorale at the work's center. Its unspoken lyrics read: "You hear me not; at night I find no peace, for you conceal, as much as it pains me, your countenance."

			<div class="text">Ensemble Dal Niente have been a crucial presence on the Frequency Series since it started. In fact, the group performed on the very first Frequency concert in April of 2013. It’s only fitting that this fearless Chicago institution returns to close out the first Frequency Festival. The group revives its much-loved “Hard Music, Hard Liquor” series for the occasion. The program pits intensely virtuosic solo works against larger ensemble pieces. In addition to fearless technical displays, listeners will be treated to the unexpected formal twists and turns of George Lewis's music. Uncompromising and adventurous, this program truly lives up to its name—also included are works by Beat Furrer, Richard Barrett, and Sivan Cohen Elias.
